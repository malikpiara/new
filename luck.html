  <h1>Creating Your Own Luck üí´</h1>
  <p>The first time I joined a meetup was in 2014. I remember spending an entire afternoon agonizing whether I should join the event. I was young, I didn‚Äôt know anyone and I had an odd preoccupation with how strangers would perceive me. I ended up showing dressed in the most uncomfortable attire I could find (back then I still thought appearances mattered more than actions. People who are great at what they do, don‚Äôt need to signal they are smart or competent by wearing preppy shirts or shoes).</p>
  <p>That‚Äôs when I met David Dias. David is currently working on improving the internet with distributed systems at Protocol Labs (YC S14) and meeting him was a pivotal moment in my life as he taught me the value of action, ownership and pragmatism over fancy words, titles and good intentions.</p>
  <p>Every time I came to him with my reluctance to join an event, start a new project or speak with someone he would tell me ‚Äúone is greater than zero‚Äù. What he was trying to say is that you gain considerably more by doing something than by not doing it provided there is no better alternative out there. This holds especially true for high school and college students who are just getting started. Back then my other options, besides joining the meetup group were staying home pretending to study for an assessment I did not really care about or playing fifa 15.</p>
  <p>I carried on with David‚Äôs words on my mind, going to meetups, approaching people I admired and inviting them for coffee and emailing tech conference organizers to let me in for free provided I helped as a volunteer (surprisingly, I cannot think of a single soul I approached that said no. Make of this what you will). This hyperactive path eventually led me to build Upframe and the Startup Playground, a place where young makers could go to learn more about product, design and technology with mentors like David so they could get started just like I did.</p>
  <p>Upframe brought me a moderate amount of attention and looking back I know it was mainly luck, not merit or knowledge that got me there in the first place. What took some introspection to realize was that I may have, inadvertently, created part of that luck by putting myself in situations that increased my chances of getting good outcomes.</p>

  <p>Picture two cardboard boxes. One contains a single marble. The other has a handful of them. If you were to shake both boxes, the latter would naturally produce more collisions. In the real world, collisions create opportunity. Some of them can produce dramatic results like the ones that led me to build Upframe or move to Berlin.</p>
  <p>Looking at the future you cannot tell when life changing events will take place. One year ago I would not believe you if you told me I would be living in Berlin. Having that in mind, you can put yourself in situations that enable serendipity to take place by exposing yourself to it. Join communities, read books, let people know what you‚Äôre working on, move to a city that has more things going on. Create your own luck.</p>
